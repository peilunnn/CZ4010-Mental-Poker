# Motivation
Poker has long been a popular card game, but many poker games have moved online. While playing poker online is convenient, ensuring fairness and security without a trusted third party is a significant challenge. This project implements the [Fast Mental Poker protocol by Wei and Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220334557_A_Fast_Mental_Poker_Protocol), ensuring secure, tamper-resistant, and fair online poker games. Our goal is to use cryptographic techniques to make online poker as trustable as traditional face-to-face games.

# Research
## Secure Peer-to-Peer Communications
- Upon joining a poker table, players establish a peer-to-peer connection.
- Every action a player takes is broadcasted to all other players using authenticated message exchange via the `p2pnetwork` python library.
- This authenticated communication ensures that only legitimate moves by authenticated players are accepted.

## Deck Encryption and Shuffling
Using the sec256k1 prime-order elliptic curve, cards are encrypted in a way that even the player who shuffles the deck cannot know the order. This ensures fairness and prevents cheating. The protocols implemented include protocols 1 - 6 as specified in the paper:
- Protocol 1 (Deck Preparation): Initial deck creation and encryption.
- Protocol 2 (Random Element Generation): Securely generating random values for shuffling.
- Protocol 3 (Shuffle): Players can shuffle the deck without knowing the card order.
- Protocol 4 (Shuffle Verification): All players can verify the fairness of the shuffle.
- Protocol 5 (Card Drawing): Players draw cards securely without revealing them to others.
- Protocol 6 (Card Opening): A player can reveal their card to all others without compromising the game.

# Development
Main Libraries:

2. `ecdsa` (For the elliptic curve cryptography involved in the protocols)
3. `pycryptodome` and `pycryptodomex` (For low-level cryptographic primitives)
4. `gmpy2` (For multiprecision arithmetic in cryptographic computations)

6. `mpmath` (For high-precision arithmetic which might be used for certain cryptographic computations)

# Setup

# Implementation Details
1. Protocol 1 (Deck Preparation): Initial deck creation and encryption
   1. Alice initiates the game by preparing an initial deck of cards.
   2. The deck is then encrypted by Alice, resulting in a deck: E<sub>Alice</sub>(M).
2. Protocol 2 (Random Element Generation): Securely generating random values for shuffling.
   1. Bob generates a random element, which will be used for shuffling and selecting cards from the encrypted deck.
3. Protocol 3 (Shuffle): Players can shuffle the deck without knowing the card order.
   1. Using the random element, Bob shuffles the encrypted deck.
4. Protocol 4 (Shuffle Verification): All players can verify the fairness of the shuffle.
  1. Alice verifies that the shuffled deck is still valid and has not been tampered with.
5. Protocol 5 (Card Drawing): Players draw cards securely without revealing them to others.
   1. For Alice's hand:
      1. Bob uses the random element to select five ciphertexts (representing five cards) from the encrypted deck and sends them back to Alice.
      2. Alice decrypts the selected ciphertexts to reveal her hand.
   2. For Bob's hand:
      1. Bob selects another set of five cards from the deck and doubly encrypts them: E<sub>Bob</sub>(E<sub>Alice</sub>(M)).
      2. This doubly encrypted hand is sent to Alice.
      3. Alice decrypts her layer of encryption and sends the resulting hand back to Bob as E<sub>Bob</sub>(M).
      4. Bob decrypts the received hand to reveal his set of cards.
   3. Alice and Bob maintain a list of selected card indices, crossing out the card numbers picked by Bob.
6. Protocol 6 (Card Opening): A player can reveal their card to all others without compromising the game.
   1. After the card drawing procedure, both Alice and Bob can choose to reveal their hands to each other.
   2. Based on standard poker rules, the player with the best 5-card hand is determined as the winner.


# FAQ
## How to prove that the deck is shuffled by the player who didnâ€™t take any advantage on that? How do you define the fairness of the shuffle?

To ensure a fair shuffle, we look at protocols 3 (shuffling) and 4 (verifying that the shuffle has been done correctly)

Shuffling:
1. Generate a random permutation of the deck using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, which results in a uniformly random permutation of the deck
2. Encrypt each card in the shuffled deck using a secret value x, which ensures that even though the player has shuffled the deck, they cannot know the new order because the cards are encrypted

Verifying that the shuffle has been done correctly:
1. Shuffle the deck multiple times. For each shuffle, generate a proof that consists of the shuffled deck, a new secret, and a new permutation
2. Using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, generate a challenge e by hashing the encrypted states of the deck (before and after shuffling).  This challenge is a fixed-size number that represents a "summary" of the shuffle without revealing specific details
3. Along with the challenge, the shuffler also generates a proof that they have applied a valid shuffle. This proof is constructed in such a way that it would only be valid if the shuffle was performed correctly
4. Other players can then recompute the challenge e by hashing the same encrypted states of the deck. They then use this challenge to verify the proof provided by the shuffler. If their reconstructed shuffled deck matches the proof's shuffled deck, the shuffle is considered fair

TLDR: we use a NIZK proof where the encrypted states of the deck before and after shuffling are known to all players. A challenge e is generated from these states using a hash function. The shuffler then provides a proof that they have shuffled the deck without knowing the card order. Other players verify this shuffle by independently computing e and checking it against the proof. If the computed e and the proof align, the shuffle is confirmed to be fair, all without revealing the actual card order or values.
